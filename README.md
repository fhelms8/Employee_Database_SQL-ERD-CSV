Welcome to my first SQL Challenge! 

With this challenge, I had to go through 6 CSV/excel files that were full of employee/department information, and I was tasked with creating an ERD to show the connections of each CSV file, along with creating and organizing 8 different lists/tables.

Unfortunately I was unable to complete the bonus activity. Below is my ERD table for easy viewing. 

Thank you for stopping by and as always, I welcome feedback to help myself grow in this field. Have a wonderful day!
